COVID-19 is kind of a blessing in disguise for me. Last year I was given the oppurtunity to share my work in one of the conference by Apache Beam community.
It was an honor to be part of the community. 

Truthfully, this was my very first technical talk :). I was a bit nervous eventhough it was quite a short talk. Overall it was a very nice experience for me.

If you want to hear my talk directly, you can watch it here or on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/aM323pLIYcM)

This was actually one of the method that I used to solved a client's problem. We needed to map and pinpoint the places provided by the client however as most data met, not all information was given thus we had to take a different approach. Moreover, based on an address in Japan, it was better to group them by layer of prefecture, city, municipality etc. 

Basically, what we did was cleaning the address, geocode it to get the coordinates and reverse the geocoding to confirm and validate the address. The reverse process also could get us the layer of address that we wanted (prefecture, city, municipality, etc.)
