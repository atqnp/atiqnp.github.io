### My story
Flown all the way from Malaysia in 2010 to complete my Engineering degree in Yamaguchi University.

Lived in a peaceful countryside called Ube, Yamaguchi until 2014. 

Moved to Yokohama and got my Ph.D in Engineering from Keio University.

Worked in an international school after graduating while waiting for my wife to finish her studies.

Introduced to the current company I am working with on 2018.
