Here goes nothing!

Bismillah (In the name of the Almighty) - 
This is usually what is written or spoken by a muslim when we want to start something or anything actually. If you feel offended about my religion please feel free to contact me :)!

Because I don't know how to start writing so this post act as a starter for the many things that is going to be written here. I will try to share my thoughts and experience of my journey. I wrote this just to get a feeling of writing as I am not a very good writer myself especially when it comes to technical writing. To err is human. So, if there is any mistakes please bear with me and feel free to correct my mistakes. We are all on a path of learning.

For those of you who wants to connect feel free to contact me!

Once again, here goes nothing!

Wrapping up for my very first post!

يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَـٰكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَـٰكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَىٰكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ

> O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Aware.
